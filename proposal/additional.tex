\section{Related Work}

A nice feature for collaboration is that you can break your document
into many files with \texttt{\\input}, and have each person work on a
different file. This works great if you have some sort of version
control such as SVN or GIT.

Finally, you may want to cite some previous work. For
example,~\cite{lamport78time} is a highly-cited paper.
The ACM digital library is a good source of BibTeX entries.

% This is a comment: if you are curious, the ~ before \cite is a
% non-breaking space: it produces a space before the citation and
% doesn't let it go to the beginning of the next line if it would
% cause a line break.
